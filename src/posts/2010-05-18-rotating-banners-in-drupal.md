# "Rotating Banners In Drupal"

2010-05-18 18:24:23 -0800

I recently gave a quick presentation at the May 2010 Fort Lauderdale Drupal User Group meetup on Rotating Banners in Drupal. I'm including the slideshow, mainly because I'm swamped with other things and am copping out of writing up a formal article on how I deal with rotating banners. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments, or drop me a line on twitter.
