This is a work in progress until this message no longer exists. I doubt I'll ever remove this message, granted.

## Storage
So I just keep it in the fridge with the lid on. It can stay in there a LONG time being ignored. We're talking months. As long as it doesn't start getting pink on top of it, it's totally fine. If there's a black-ish liquid on top, that's just alcohol. You can pour it out, it's fine.

## Feeding
Honestly, if you're keeping it in the fridge, I just feed it the day before I plan on using it, but more responsible people will feed it every 1-2 weeks. This involves mixing in equal parts by weight of flour and water.

## Getting ready to use
If it's been in the fridge, you'll probably want to do this the day before. Take it out of the fridge and give it a feeding, and then let it just sit on the counter. It should double in volume in 12-24 hours (maybe faster if you've been using it often).

## Quick Recipe
I really like King Arthur for bread stuff, so instead of below, you could follow this (pain de campagne recipe)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL6ogX38NcY] instead of below, or incorporate bits and pieces of both.

- 100g sourdough starter
- 200g water
- 300g flour
- 10g salt

1. Mix everything together, let sit 15 minutes with a towel or something on top of it.
2. Fold the dough on itself a few times (look up envelope folds on youtube), let rest 30 minutes with towel on top of it.
3. Repeat the fold/rest bit like another 2-3 times (however much patience you have to do it, the more times you fold, the stronger the dough will be because you're developing gluten with those folds)
4. Let rise for like 8 hours (I just do this overnight). You can also just let this hang out in the fridge for a few days.
5. Shape it into the shape you want. Put it on parchment (it'll help you lift it into the hot potential dutch oven you're using). Let rest for 2-3 hours of your last proof.
6. Baking - if you have a dutch oven, that's the way to get the best results. Heat up oven with the dutch oven and lid inside it to 425 for like 15-30 minutes. When ready, open oven, carefully put bread into dutch oven (mainly so you don't burn yourself), put lid on dutch oven, bake for 20 minutes. Then take off lid and bake for another 15 minutes or so. If you don't have a dutch oven, you can heat up a baking sheet in the oven and put the bread directly on it and cook until it looks done, which is probably like 25-30 minutes.
7. Take out of oven and put on a rack, let cool (you'll sometimes hear the bread sing when it's on the rack, from the steam escaping through the crust, it's really cool), put good things on bread, enjoy.
