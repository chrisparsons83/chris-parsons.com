# My _Jeopardy!_ Appearance

Most people that know me know that I was on _Jeopardy!_ within moments of meeting me. This isn't any of my doing, but without fail, it's very easy to go "Hey, meet my friend Chris, he's my friend that was on _Jeopardy!_". Being born in Florida, I know there are [way](https://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/346-pound-man-punches-dominos-pizza-guy-for-forgetting-his-garlic-knots-cops-say-6471471) [worse](https://miami.cbslocal.com/2020/07/10/florida-man-iguana-bike-crash/) [things](https://nypost.com/2020/07/23/florida-man-tries-to-evade-arrest-by-cartwheeling-away-from-cops/) that one could be known for, so I'll gladly take this introduction.

However, most of my friends haven't seen the full videos of my episodes. This seems like the most reasonable place to resolve that.

## Day 1: Wednesday, March 3rd, 2004

Fun notes:

- Yes, I almost swore on my first response. It was great.
- My Final Jeopardy answer was basically a guess. I could remember a TV ad at the time for Chicago and I could remember a prison cell. I've watched it since, I promise.
- They tape five episodes in a day, and between the Wednesday and Thursday episodes was the lunch break on the Sony Studios lot. I had so much adrenaline rushing through me for a good 20 minutes after this game that I couldn't even fathom eating, and I've never seen my hands shaking as much as they did then.

## Day 2: Thursday, March 4th, 2004

Fun notes:

- I have no idea why I went dressier this episode.
- I almost went true daily double for $10k, and got spooked by muskellunge. I talked myself out of it, and I knew exactly what an archaeopteryx was, which is why I sounded annoyed.
- Matt asked me if I wanted to go out drinking after the last episode taped since we both had all of the sudden won a fair amount of money. I was 20 so I had to pass. Matt, if somehow you ever read this, I would 100% go drinking with you now. You name the place and bar.
